description: "Terms of Service for Commercial http4k subscriptions"
---

By signing this agreement, you and any entity that you represent ("Customer") are unconditionally consenting to be bound by and are becoming a party to these http4k Commercial Subscription Terms ("Agreement") as of the date of Customer's first download of the Licensed Materials (the "Effective Date").

This Agreement implements and defines the "valid subscription" requirement established in the http4k Commercial License. It details the subscription framework, general terms and conditions, and support services that constitute a valid subscription for commercial use of the Licensed Materials. For clarity, while the Commercial License establishes the fundamental requirement of a valid subscription for commercial use, this Agreement provides the framework for such subscriptions, with specific pricing and service details provided through Customer Quotes.

This agreement governs the provision of subscriptions to http4k Pro and Enterprise Editions. All commercial use requires a valid subscription obtained through http4k's official channels. Use of http4k Pro and Enterprise Editions is governed by the http4k Commercial License (available at http4k.org/commercial-license). By obtaining or activating a subscription, you and/or your organization agree to comply with all terms of the Commercial License.

By purchasing a subscription or using the Licensed Materials, you and/or your organization agree to comply with all terms of the Commercial License.

Customer's continued use of the software or any Licensed Materials provided by http4k Ltd or one of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, as specified on an order form or quote ("http4k") shall also constitute assent to the terms of this agreement.

If these terms are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. If you are executing this agreement on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to do so.

If an audit reveals underpayment, then Customer shall promptly pay the deficiency to http4k plus late fees pursuant to Section 5. http4k shall bear the cost of an audit unless the audit reveals underpayment by more than 5% for the audited period, in which case Customer shall promptly pay http4k for the reasonable costs of the audit.

## 3. CONFIDENTIALITY

3.1 Each party (the "Receiving Party") understands that the other party (the "Disclosing Party") has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party's technology or business (hereinafter referred to as "Proprietary Information" of the Disclosing Party). Without limiting the foregoing, the Licensed Materials are http4k Proprietary Information.

3.2 The Receiving Party agrees: (i) not to divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information, (ii) to give access to such Proprietary Information solely to those employees with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (iii) to take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Proprietary Information that the party takes with its own proprietary information, but in no event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party, or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Proprietary Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order. In any event, http4k may collect data with respect to and report on the aggregate response rate and other aggregate measures of the Licensed Materials' performance and Customer's usage of the Licensed Materials; provided that http4k will not identify Customer as the source of any such data without Customer's prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, use of a third party to host the data collected shall not be deemed a disclosure.

3.3 Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other may suffer irreparable damage in the event of a breach of the terms of Sections 1.1, 2.1 or 3.2 of this Agreement and that such party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief (without the necessity of posting a bond) in the event of any such breach.

3.4 Both parties will have the right to disclose the existence of the relationship between the parties, but not the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such disclosure of the Agreement terms is approved in writing by both Parties prior to such disclosure, or is included in a filing required to be made by a party with a governmental authority (provided such party will use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order) or is made on a confidential basis as reasonably necessary to potential investors or acquirers.

## 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

4.1 Except as expressly set forth herein, http4k alone (and its licensors, where applicable) will retain all intellectual property rights relating to the Licensed Materials, while Customer shall retain all rights to Customer modifications made in accordance with Section 1.1.1. Any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, code, or other recommendations provided by Customer, its Affiliates or any third party relating to the Licensed Materials (excluding Customer modifications made under Section 1.1.1), are hereby assigned to http4k. This Agreement is not a sale and does not convey to Customer any rights of ownership in or related to the Licensed Materials, or any intellectual property rights.

4.2 Customer shall not remove, alter or obscure any of http4k's (or its licensors') copyright notices, proprietary legends, trademark or service mark attributions, patent markings or other indicia of http4k's (or its licensors') ownership or contribution from the Licensed Materials. Additionally, Customer agrees to reproduce and include http4k's (and its licensors') proprietary and copyright notices on any copies of the Licensed Materials, or on any portion thereof, including reproduction of the copyright notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, certain components of the Licensed Materials may include or use third party components which are licensed under the terms described in such source code annotations.

4.3 Customer and its licensors shall (and Customer hereby represents and warrants that they do) have and retain all right, title and interest (including, without limitation, sole ownership of) all software, information, content and data provided by or on behalf of Customer or made available or otherwise distributed through use of the Licensed Materials ("Content") and the intellectual property rights with respect to that Content. If http4k receives any notice or claim that any Content, or Customer's activities hereunder (including without limitation, with respect to any Content), infringes or violates the rights of a third party or any applicable law or regulation (a "Claim"), Customer will indemnify, defend and hold http4k harmless from all liability, damages, settlements, attorney fees and other costs and expenses in connection with any such Claim, as incurred. The immediately foregoing indemnity obligations are expressly conditioned on http4k providing Customer with prompt notice of, and reasonable cooperation and sole control over the defense and/or settlement of the applicable Claim. Subject to the foregoing, http4k may participate in the defense and/or settlement of any applicable Claim with counsel of its choosing at its own expense.

4.4 http4k will defend, indemnify and hold Customer harmless from liability and other amounts paid or payable to unaffiliated third parties resulting from (i) the infringement or violation of any intellectual property or proprietary rights by the Licensed Materials or (ii) the violation of applicable law or regulation by http4k in performance of its obligations hereunder, provided http4k is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and the opportunity to assume sole control over defense and settlement thereof. Subject to the foregoing, Customer may participate in the defense and/or settlement of any claim that is indemnifiable by http4k with counsel of its choosing at its own expense. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to portions or components of the Licensed Materials (i) not created by http4k, (ii) that are modified after delivery by http4k, (iii) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (iv) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (v) where Customer's use of the Licensed Materials is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement and all related documentation.

## 5. PAYMENT OF FEES

5.1 License Fees
Unless otherwise specified in an executed Quote or handled through a reseller, Customer will pay http4k the applicable fees as set forth at https://http4k.org (the "Pricing") for the Licensed Materials selected and/or used by Customer (the "Fees") without any right of set-off or deduction.
