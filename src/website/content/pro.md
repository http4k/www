faq:
    -   question: "How are http4k Pro modules different from the http4k Community modules?"
        answer: "Pro modules are commercially licensed extensions developed specifically to solve common enterprise use cases. They are distributed under **org.http4k.pro** Maven coordinate group. You can find details of the http4k Commercial License [below](#license)."
        
    -   question: "Does this mean the Pro modules are more reliable than http4k Community?"
        answer: "No. All http4k modules share the same high quality standards and testing rigor. Pro modules provide additional enterprise-focused features rather than enhanced reliability."
            
    -   question: "How are the modules licensed?"
        answer: "Pro modules are licensed annually per floating developer seat for both development and production use, meaning multiple developers can use the modules but only one developer per seat at a time. Licenses include access to Maven artifacts via Maven Central and technical support via GitHub issues."
            
    -   question: "My organisation wishes to use several of the http4k Pro modules. Can we buy a bundle of licenses?"
        answer: "Yes. We offer volume discounts for organisations that wish to purchase multiple Pro modules. Please contact us using the button below."

    -   question: "Can I use Pro modules for free?"
        answer: "We are completely supportive of experimentation with http4k technologies, so Pro modules are free for non-commercial, research and non-profit use cases."
