### Installation (Gradle)

```kotlin
dependencies {
    {{< http4k_bom >}}
    
    // Java (for development only):
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-core")
    
    // Apache v5 (Sync): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-apache")
    
    // Apache v4 (Sync): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-apache4")
    
    // Apache v5 (Async): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-apache-async")
    
    // Apache v4 (Async): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-apache4-async")
    
    // Fuel (Sync + Async): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-fuel")
    
    // Helidon (Loom): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-helidon")
    
    // Jetty (Sync + Async + WebSocket): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-jetty")
    
    // OkHttp (Sync + Async): 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-okhttp")
    
    // Websocket: 
    implementation("org.http4k:http4k-client-websocket")
}
```

### HTTP
Supported HTTP client adapter APIs are wrapped to provide an `HttpHandler` interface in 1 LOC.
Since each client acts as an `HttpHandler`, it can be decorated with various `Filter` implementations, such as those available in `ClientFilters`.
This allows handling cross-cutting concerns independently of a specific client implementation, greatly facilitating testing.

Activate streaming mode by passing a `BodyMode` (default is non-streaming).

`ClientFilters` offers a collection of filters that can be applied to an `HttpHandler` to manage common cross-cutting concernsas a chain of filters. 
This chain allows for the easy configuration and management of complex processing sequences.
`ClientFilters` includes specific filters that enable frequently needed functionalities like authentication, caching, or compression with minimal configuration.

These examples are for the Apache HTTP client, but the API is similar for the others:

Additionally, all HTTP client adapter modules allow for custom configuration of the relevant underlying client. Async-supporting clients implement the `AsyncHttpClient` interface can be passed a callback.

### Websocket
http4k supplies both blocking and non-blocking Websocket clients. The former is perfect for integration testing purposes, and as it uses the same interface `WsClient` as the in-memory test client (`WsHandler.testWsClient()`) it is simple to write unit tests which can then be reused as system tests by virtue of swapping out the client.

### Feature support

**http4k** provides support for the following Client backends:
